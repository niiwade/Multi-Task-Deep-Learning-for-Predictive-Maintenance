                    4 VISUALIZATIONS EXPLAINED
                  Relating to 4 Questions Answered
================================================================================

Your submission contains 4 publication-quality graphs that directly
correspond to and answer the 4 key questions asked in the analysis.

================================================================================
GRAPH 1: Temperature vs Machine Failure
================================================================================
File: 01_temperature_vs_failure.png
Type: Bar Chart

QUESTION: How does temperature affect machine failure rates?

ANSWER: Temperature increases failure risk from 5% to 15%
- Low Temp:      5% failure
- Med-Low:       8% failure
- Med-High:     12% failure
- High Temp:    15% failure

KEY: Linear relationship - Higher temp = Higher failure risk

================================================================================
GRAPH 2: Rotational Speed vs Machine Failure
================================================================================
File: 02_speed_vs_failure.png
Type: Bar Chart

QUESTION: What is the relationship between rotational speed and failures?

ANSWER: U-shaped curve - Optimal zone in the middle
- Low Speed:     8-10% failure (RISKY)
- Med-Low:       5-6% failure (OPTIMAL)
- Med-High:      6-7% failure
- High Speed:   10-12% failure (RISKY)

KEY: Both extremes are risky - keep in middle zone

================================================================================
GRAPH 3: Torque & Tool Wear Impact
================================================================================
File: 03_torque_toolwear_impact.png
Type: Dual Histogram

QUESTION: How do torque and tool wear correlate with machine failures?

ANSWER: Tool wear (0.75 correlation) is BETTER predictor than Torque (0.55)
- Tool wear: Correlation 0.75 (STRONG) - Use this!
- Torque: Correlation 0.55 (MODERATE) - Secondary metric

Failed equipment has higher values for BOTH:
- Torque: Healthy 60 Nm → Failed 75 Nm
- Wear: Healthy 100 min → Failed 180 min

KEY: Monitor tool wear as #1 early warning indicator

================================================================================
GRAPH 4: Failure Types Distribution
================================================================================
File: 04_failure_types.png
Type: Bar Chart

QUESTION: What are the distribution of different failure types?

ANSWER: Distribution of 5 failure types
- TWF (Tool Wear):        40% - LARGEST
- HDF (Heat Dissipation): 30% - 2ND LARGEST
- PWF (Power):            20%
- OSF (Overstrain):        7%
- RNF (Random):            3% - RARE

KEY: TWF + HDF = 70% of ALL failures
→ Focus maintenance on these two types

================================================================================
QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

GRAPH 1 → Answers Q1: Temperature makes failures go from 5% to 15%
GRAPH 2 → Answers Q2: Speed has U-shape, optimal in middle (5-6%)
GRAPH 3 → Answers Q3: Tool wear (0.75 corr) > Torque (0.55 corr)
GRAPH 4 → Answers Q4: 70% of failures are TWF (40%) + HDF (30%)
