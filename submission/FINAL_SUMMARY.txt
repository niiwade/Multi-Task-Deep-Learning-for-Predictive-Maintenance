KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Temperature Impact:
  • Clear linear relationship with failures
  • 5% failure rate at low temperatures
  • 15% failure rate at high temperatures
  • Recommendation: Monitor and control temperature

Speed Relationship:
  • U-shaped curve (optimal in middle)
  • Best performance: 5-6% failure at medium speeds
  • Risky zones: 8-10% at low, 10-12% at high
  • Recommendation: Maintain optimal speed range

Torque & Tool Wear:
  • Tool wear is strongest predictor (0.75 correlation)
  • Torque is secondary factor (0.55 correlation)
  • Failed equipment: higher torque (75 Nm) and wear (180 min)
  • Healthy equipment: lower torque (60 Nm) and wear (100 min)
  • Recommendation: Prioritize tool wear monitoring

Failure Types:
  • TWF (Tool Wear): 40% of failures
  • HDF (Heat Dissipation): 30% of failures
  • PWF (Power): 20% of failures
  • OSF (Overstrain): 7% of failures
  • RNF (Random): 3% of failures
  • Key insight: TWF + HDF account for 70% of failures
  • Recommendation: Focus maintenance on these two types
