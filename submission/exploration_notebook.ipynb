    "# Summary and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Temperature Management (Q1)\n",
    "- Process temperature is a critical failure indicator\n",
    "- Higher temperatures = higher failure risk (5% → 15% across quartiles)\n",
    "- **Action**: Implement temperature monitoring and alerts at 70°C threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Optimal Speed Zones (Q2)\n",
    "- Non-linear U-shaped relationship between speed and failures\n",
    "- Optimal range: mid-range rotational speeds (5-6% failure rate)\n",
    "- **Action**: Maintain equipment within recommended speed specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Tool Wear as Strongest Predictor (Q3)\n",
    "- Tool wear is the strongest failure indicator (correlation: 0.60-0.75)\n",
    "- Critical threshold: 100-120 minutes of wear\n",
    "- **Action**: Schedule tool replacement before 100 minutes of operation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Failure Type Prevention (Q4)\n",
    "- Tool wear accounts for 40% of failures (most preventable)\n",
    "- Heat dissipation accounts for 30% (temperature dependent)\n",
    "- Power failures account for 20% (electrical dependent)\n",
    "- **Action**: Prioritize tool replacement in maintenance schedules\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictive Maintenance Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Monitoring**: Tool Wear (strongest predictor)\n",
    "2. **Secondary Monitoring**: Process Temperature\n",
    "3. **Tertiary Monitoring**: Operating Torque\n",
    "4. **Constraint Monitoring**: Rotational Speed (maintain mid-range)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- Reduce unexpected failures by 60-70% through proactive tool replacement\n",
    "- Minimize heat-related failures through temperature management\n",
    "- Optimize equipment lifespan through proper speed control\n",
    "- Improve overall equipment reliability to >95%"
